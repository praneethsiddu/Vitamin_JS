My JavaScript key Notes:

#### Naming conventions for variables:

1.Camel case type variables are used in the javascript example: 'firstName'  
2.Variable names must not start with Capital letters  
3.Variable name only starts with alphabets, '_ ' and '$' in javascript  
4.Variable can contains alphabets, numbers, '$' , '_'  
5.Reserve keywords like new, function,.........cannot be used as variables  
6.Variable names with all uppercase letters are denoted as constants For example  

### primitive data types in javascript

1.Numbers: both floating points numbers and Integer numbers  
Syntax  
let age=18  
let height=5.11  

2.String: used for text.  
let firstname="preetham" //or 'preetham' or `partapu`  

3.boolean:  
let=true //or false  

4.undefined: empty value.  
let firstname;  
typeof firstname  
output:  
undefined  

5.Null: empty value  

6 symbol  

7 Bigint: Larger Integers  
JavaScript has dynamic typing: we need not define the variable type it will be automatically figured out dynamically based on the value stored in the variable

# Fundamentals
1.let keyword is used to declare the variables when we want to reassign the variable value or  mutate
let age=18
age=20

2.const keyword is used to declare the variables when we don't want to reassign variable value
const birth=1991
birth=1993//Error

3.var keyword is old way of defining the variables
var firstname="preetham"
firstname="praneeth"

#### Operators

1.Assingment

2.comparison operators

3.logical operators

4.bitwise operator

5.turnary operator

JavaScript has all the operators what a programing language has
