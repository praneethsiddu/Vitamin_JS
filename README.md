My JavaScript key Notes:

###Naming conventions for variables

camel case type variables are used in the javascript example: 'firstName'
variable names must not start with Capital letters
variable name only starts with alphabets, '_ ' and '$' in javascript
variable can contains alphabets, numbers, '$' , '_'
reserve keywords like new, function,.........cannot be used as variables
Variable names with all uppercase letters are denoted as constants For example
